        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS aka cascading style sheet is used to define how webpage content is presented to users.It defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>The three ways to syle a webpage using CSS is Inline CSS, Internal CSS StyleSheet, and External CSS StyleSheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS your styling element is directly in the HTML file. It is quick and permanent but not as flexible as external and internal CSS.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS the rules for a webpage are in the head section of a HTML file. The rules only apply to that page and any change will apply to all taged page elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS keeps the rules in a separate file. It it the most common because it makes design changes easier. Use a link element placed in the head to link the separate files.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns separates code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Use an asterik symbol to apply a rule to all elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Declarations: contain 2 important components; the css property we want to apply, and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Combine two selectors with a comma to allow the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>DRY: Do not Repeat Yourself</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
          <li>rel: specifies relationship betweeen current document and linked document resource.</li>
          <li>href: specifies location URL of external resource.</li>
          <li>Class attribute: share a css rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks and each line of JS code ends with a semicolon.</li>

          <li>Use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which the code is executed.</li>
          <li>When using if statment it will check to see if the condition is truthy. If it is then the action will execute if not then it will ignore.</li>
          <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate.</li>
          <li>An array is a group of related data.</li>

          <li>First item in any array has a index of 0 not 1.</li>
          <li>A for loop can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes in our array and log them to the console until there are no shapes left.</li>
          <li>To find the length of the array use the built in property of an arrary named length.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three important statements: starting point for our loop, condition, and the final statement that allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Two requirements for a JavaScript function: Define the function, and call the function.</li>
