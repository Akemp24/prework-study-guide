## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to learn basic HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and to have all that knowledge acessible in one place. This website was built so there would be a reference guide on those four subjects. This helps if you may not remember something about a topic and you can go back for a reference or just to study!
